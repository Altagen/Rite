## Notes

- **Current priority:** Phase 1 MVP - Transition from "SSH client" to "modern terminal with SSH support"
- **New product direction:** RITE is now a full-featured terminal (local shell + SSH), not just an SSH client
- **Master password consideration:** Current unlock-per-launch may need rethinking for daily terminal usage (deferred to post-MVP)
- Security features are prioritized across all phases
- Features may be reordered based on user feedback and technical dependencies
- Phase numbers are organizational, not strict timelines
- Web version (Phase 5) is a long-term goal, not blocking MVP release

## Phase 1 MVP Priority Order (Updated)

**Critical path for usable terminal:**
1. **Local terminal** (foundation for terminal usage)
2. **Split panes** (essential modern feature)
3. **Command palette** (UX quick wins)
4. **Font/theme customization** (personalization)
5. **Import ~/.ssh/config** (migration path)
6. **Export/backup** (security)
7. **Polish & stability** (error handling, notifications)
